		<h3>Data Structures Sorting Project</h3>
		<p>For this project, I was required to parse through a given file, organize it into different fields (Country Name, Code, Capitol, 
		Population, GDP, and Happiness Rank)<br> and then sorting those fields depending on the options that the user selects. The first thing
  		the user has to input is the name of a valid file, "Countries1.csv".<br> Once they input a valid file, the user will have a choice between 6
  		options: Print a report of all the countries and their data, sort the countries by their name alphabetically, sort the countries by
  		their happiness rank,<br> sort the countries by their GDP per Capita, find and print a specific country that they also input, or quitting.</p>

		<h3>Introduction to Databases Case Study</h3>
		<p>For this project, my group was required to research a real company and learn about how they keep information about day-to-day business. We chose to research Walmart's Grocery Section.<br> Once we have determined
		their various attributes and entities, we then put them into SQL so they could be manipulated and stored.</p>
